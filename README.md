## ShrampyBot Mk. III - The Golden Shrimp Guild Mastodon Bot

This is a bot being used and developed actively by the [Golden Shrimp Guild](https://gsg.live) for announcing when streamers on the gsg.live Mastodon instance go live.

ShrampyBot Mk. III has been rewritten (yes, again...) in Django!

More to come.
